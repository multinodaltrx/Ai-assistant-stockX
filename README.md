AI Financial Co-pilot üìà
AI Financial Co-pilot is an intelligent chatbot that serves as a conversational interface for complex financial data. Built with Python, Streamlit, and OpenAI's GPT-4o, this application makes it easy for anyone to get instant answers to questions about stocks, cryptocurrencies, and forex markets.

Instead of navigating cluttered websites and complex trading terminals, users can simply ask questions in natural language and receive immediate, accurate data.
